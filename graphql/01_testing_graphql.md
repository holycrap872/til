## Testing GraphQL

A "graph ql" playground exists at https://pet-library.moonhighway.com/

> By the standard, every GraphQL implementation automatically comes with
a "playground". This means that the moonhighway is just an implementation
of the schema and then all of the niceties (nice web page, ability to
test, ability to read the schema) come from free.
