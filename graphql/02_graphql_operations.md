# GraphQL Operations

Instead of CRUD (create, read, update, delete), graph QL gives you two types
of operations: `query` and `mutation`.

`query` -> ["read"]
`mutation` -> ["create", "update", "delete"]

In addition to these two base operations, GraphQL also gives you a
`subscription` type, that sets up a listening websocket for you.
