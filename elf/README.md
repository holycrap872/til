# Explanation

This folder is a little bit different than my other til's.  In this case, I am experimenting
on various headers and examining their output.  Therefore, I have set up this folder as an
analysis of various programs.  Each of these analysis's may reference each other.

## What is ELF?

TBD

##Analysing hello.c

Program: [hello.c](hello.c)

ELF: [hello](hello)

Examining the ELF Header: [readelf -h hello](readelf_-f_hello.md)

Examining the Program Headers : [readelf -l hello](readelf_-l_hello.md)

Examining the Binary: [objdump -D hello](objdump_-D_hello.md)
