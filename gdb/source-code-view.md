#Source Code View

Super simple, but I had no idea such a thing existed.  In order to
view where you are in the source code while debugging all the time
(rather than intermitently ala `list`), simply type `win` when you
enter gdb or, alternatively use `gdbtui`.

The real lesson here is that if you want something in UNIX, it
probably exists.  The real trick is just finding it.
