> Today I Learned

A collection of concise write-ups on small things I learn day to day across a
variety of languages and technologies. These are things that don't really
warrant a full blog post. These are mostly things I learn by working with
smart people at [GrammaTech](http://grammatech.com).

### git-svn

- [Checkout SVN Repo Using git-svn](git-svn/checkout-svn-repo.md)

### GDB

- [Skipping Useless Files While Debugging](gdb/skipping-useless-files.md)
- [View Source Code While Debugging](gdb/source-code-view.md)

### VirtualBox
- [Set up Shared Folder](virtualbox/set-up-shared-folder.md)

## About

I shamelessly stole this idea from
[jbranchaud/til](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til) who in turn shamelessly
stole it from [thoughtbot/til](https://github.com/thoughtbot/til).
